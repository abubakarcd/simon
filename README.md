The Simon Game is a memory and pattern recognition game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The sequence gets progressively longer, and the player must remember and replicate the pattern without making mistakes.

This is a digital version of the Simon Game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game involves random patterns of lights and sounds, which the player must repeat to continue. The game gets more challenging as the sequence length increases.
